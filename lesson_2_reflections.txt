A .git folder is created to keep track of file changes from commits.

In staging area, you can add files which is changed.
Working directory and repository simply stores all files no matter changed or not.
Both working directory and repository act as a place to store files.

It sometimes requires changing multiple files within one logical change.
So I can use the staging area to commit multiple files at the same time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?
It would be helpful if I want to try out some experimental features
while keeping the working version.
I can also distinguish the features of different versions through branch names.

The diagram helps me better understand the branching point of commits, or logical changes.

Merging the diagram can introduce new features into the working version.
The diagram helps visualize the concept of merging branches.

Automatic merging makes developing more efficient
since manually checking the changes takes a lot of effort.
