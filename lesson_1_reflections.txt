Using diff makes it easier to find the place where typo may happen.

Sometimes the idea may not be appropriate for current project but
might be useful for future use.

pros: I can make meaningful commits.
cons: It is hard to determine when to commit
      and sometimes prone to manual mistakes.

Git is designed for programmers. But Google Docs and isn't
While program files may require multiple files at a time,
documents are usually independent.

I can use them to find out changes and retrieve older versions.

It makes me feel safe because I can always go back to previous versions.

I would like to try Git mainly for my web page assignment.
But it would be useful if I can use Git for co-note version control.
